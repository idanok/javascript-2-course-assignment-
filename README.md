## Social media front-end application
A front-end web application allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on their own posts, as well as implement additional features such as following/unfollowing users. 

## What my application does:
A front-end social media app where users can register, log in, create, edit, delete, and view posts, follow/unfollow users, search posts, and view profiles.

## Why these technologies were used:
- JavaScript (ES6 modules): For dynamic, interactive, and modular functionality.
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind optional): For page structure and responsive styling.
- Noroff API: Handles authentication, posts, and user profiles.
- Netlify: For easy deployment

## Challenges & future features:
Challenges included managing authenticated requests and dynamic DOM updates. Future improvements: real-time notifications, enhanced UI/UX, and post reactions/comments.

## Usage:
1. Register a new user on the Register Page.
2. Log in on the Login Page.
3. View all posts in the Feed Page or click posts to view individually.
4. Create, edit, or delete your posts.
5. Follow/unfollow other users and search posts.
6. View your profile on the Profile Page.

Authentication: Some pages require login. Use credentials created during registration.
